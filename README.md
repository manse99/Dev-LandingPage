# Dev-LandingPage

Minimal landing page for developers.

Developers don't talk much. Their code does all the talking. So here's a minimal landing page for developers.

Why? start with why
I wanted a dev landing page to showcase everything I do online and I wanted it to be minimal and right to the point rather beautiful and hefty. And I think most of the devs out there would want the same.

So I sat down one night and created this Dev Landing Page. Feel free to fork, clone, play around and make this your own.
